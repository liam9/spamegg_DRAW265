Original algorithm
	
	1. start with a line
	
	2. scale the line by 1/2^(1/2)

	3. rotate the line by -45 degrees around the start of the line
	
	4. add a copy of the line, rotated 90 degrees around the end of the original line

		(after the first itteration it will appear as if the original line was the 
			hypotenuse of the 2 new lines)	
	
Algorithm for determining each turn in a dragon curve:

	1. Add a right turn to the string

	2. Take the original string and flip it backward (first character last, last first)

	3. Take the flipped version and switch all the rights to lefts and the lefts to rights

	4. Add the flipped version to the new string we made in the first step
	
Example:
	
	1. RRLRRLL + R = RRLRRLLR

	2. RRLRRLL flipped = LLRRLRR

	3. LLRRLRR switched = RRLLRLL

	4. RRLRRLLR + RRLLRLL = RRLRRLLRRRLLRLL
	

Or you can think about it in terms of unfloding:

	1. start with a line or hook shape
	
	2. make a copy of the shape, rotate it 90 degrees counter clockwise and attach 
				it to the end of the shape
		
	3. repeat step 2 with new shape
